## VERIPAD NOTES
All of the info below is subject to change as being based on my currnet understanding and gathering. Above all, discussion and idea exchange are key for successful innovation initiative.

### 1. Vision
From Veripad One-Pager
 ```We are working to create a world where people no
	longer suffer from counterfeit and substandard
	medicines. We dream that one day mistrust of medicine
	will be a thing of the past, and we work diligently to
	achieve that dream. We empower any individuals to test
	the quality of medicines using our affordable solution. In
	doing so, we strengthen the trust and loyalty between
	patients and pharmacies
```

### 2. Business model
B2B and B2C are quite different in the way they approach enterprise and consumers. As B2B comes with longterm relationship, bigger-size deal, longer time of process, decision making and negotiation , involving numerous stakeholders, B2C is ofter more direct, with wider ranger of customer base, interactions, feedback, sale volume (or number of customers) / price tradeoff in many case.

Starting with B2B, it would mean doing business with enterprises, specifically medical companies, governmental organizations, NGOs, medical school, labs. In the essence, it will provide a bulk of products (physical (pads) and software (apps)) plus opportunities for further research, teaching, business consulting to constantly improve the value of offering or develop more products (software, hardware or combine both).

B2C will closely related to how we understand the consumer (or patient) market, particular their motivation. For example, one purchasing drugs may find it tedious to test every single time they buy them, how can we persuade them to do the testing (or buy testing solution) for their own benefit? Some companies are answering that through a mechanism of brand trust, like asking customer to text the secret number embedded in each drug bottle by producers, get verified message back, hence the increased trust to the brand. Customers are free of charged. The business model is actually B2B2C, with pharmaceutical and distributors paying the bill. However, it all depends on the willingness of distributors to engage into such solution as they may not want to be transparent on the product, or they are the one who duplicate all the drugs under the same label or secret number. Veripad will possibly face the same challenge in adoption.

As Veripad is in its epiphany, raising awareness through different social media channels, connecting to expect and voices on those platform will be very helpful. After a short research, I suggest to contact **Roger Bate**(https://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-bate-149b0b4/) of American Enterprise Institute as he has been chasing the topic for a while. Another noticeable voice is of **Bejon Misra**(https://www.linkedin.com/in/bejon-misra-1a465a4b/), founder of Safe Medicine, India, with his insights into the country of second largest population.

Notes:
The reason why I was asking about insurance company's presence in the countries where the product is launched is that they have a real motivation to make sure there customer using good-quality medicines, so either they give there clients as part of the deal or introduce them to products like Veripad.  

### 2. Pricing & Selling Strategy
Though we see  price tag everyday, we might be not aware that it is actually a common way for companies to express their vision, status, product quality, power of bargaining, customer reach ... If they just realize only part of these, they may be offering less value than they wish.

Before going further, we need to keep in mind:
1. Value has nothing to do with cost
2. Value is created at the end user
3. All value is relative

There are indeed many way of pricing. For example, subscription based (very popular) (iTunes, Spotify, web-based services...), one-stop-shop (supermarkets), tiers (airline tickets - Economic/Business class), add-ons (products and then value-added services)

As I learned about pricing, I cannot stress enough how important it is to make a successful business, as it ties closely to cost management, the value of offering and how the business positions itself.
If we just consider selling pad as a commodity product, we can only sell as much as they are needed with fix price. Our gross revenue will be defined by volume (sale) x price per unit. In case of B2C, it will make it more affordable for people, with only consideration of adjusting price would increase customer base (volume), which is favorable in low-income countries.

In B2B case, it would be better to go with a 'package' offering. For example, a package of 200 new pads/month with mobile application constantly updated and 20 working days collaboration each year. The value of the offering hence contains not only the production cost, but the cost B2B customer can save when they eliminate counterfeit drugs and sell more quality product problem, and also hours of research by themselves. Veripad team can play a more active role in further collaboration with their labs, doing further research and develop new products for new requirements.


### 3. Funding

> The contribution I made here is the modest I can do to support and encourage you to continue making quality pharmaceutical product within the reach of people and address the long-standing problem in Africa and many other places. I do not assume that something will only have a good side, there are side effects too. But I do think that you are on the right track. Keep up !!!

> You may find MarketResearch.md, Supervisors.md and other documents in Market Research folder many good information. I'm really busy right now, so maybe I will send you the use case of data next week. Again, don't hesitate to ask me anything!
