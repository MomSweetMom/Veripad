## VERIPAD NOTES##

### 1. Vision
	From One-page
''' We are working to create a world where people no
longer suffer from counterfeit and substandard
medicines. We dream that one day mistrust of medicine
will be a thing of the past, and we work diligently to
achieve that dream. We empower any individuals to test
the quality of medicines using our affordable solution. In
doing so, we strengthen the trust and loyalty between
patients and pharmacies.'''

### 2. Business model
	B2B and B2C are quite different in the way they approach enterprise and consumers. As B2B comes with longterm relationship, bigger-size deal, longer time of process, decision making and negotiation , involving numerous stakeholders, B2C is ofter more direct, with wider ranger of customer base, interactions, feedback, more price sensitive.

	Starting with B2B, it would mean doing business with enterprises, specifically medical companies, governmental organizations, NGOs, medical school, labs. In the essence, it will provide a bulk of products (physical (pads) and software (apps)) plus opportunities for further research, teaching, business consulting to constantly improve the value of offering or develop more products.

	B2C would be harder. If one customer buys different products from different vendors, it will be a hassle for them to test every single day to  and test it all the time, it would be very hard,


	The reason why I was asking about insurance company's presence in the countries where the product is launched is that they have a real motivation to make sure there customer using good-quality medicines, so either they give there clients as part of the deal or introduce them to products like Veripad.  

### 2. Pricing & Selling Strategy
	Though we see  price tag everyday, we might be not aware that it is actually a common way for companies to express their vision, status, product quality, power of bargaining, customer reach ... If they just realize only part of these, they may be offering less value than they wish.

	Before going further, we need to keep in mind:
	1. Value has nothing to do with cost
	2. Value is created at the end user
	3. All value is relative

	There are indeed many way of pricing. For example, subscription based (very popular) (iTunes, Spotify, web-based services...), one-stop-shop (supermarkets), tiers (airline tickets - Economic/Business class), add-ons (products and then value-added services)

	As I learned about pricing, I cannot stress enough how important it is to make a successful business, as it ties closely to cost management, the value of offering and how the business positions itself.
	If we just consider selling pad as a commodity product, we can only sell as much as they are needed with fix price. Our gross revenue will be defined by volume (sale) x price per unit. In case of B2C, it will make it more affordable for people, with only consideration of adjusting price would increase customer base (volume), which is our main focus. While in B2B case, it would be better to go with a 'package' offering. For example, $10k/year including 100 new pads/month, constantly update mobile application and 20 days support. In the eyes of potential institutional customers, the product is actually positioned itself as an excellent solution for they needs, saving them abundant cost of addressing drugs counterfeit problem  and hours of research. What is more, Veripad team will play an active role in further collaboration with their labs, teaching (public school for examples), doing further research and develop new products for new requirements.
